# Drag-Drop

This code implements a drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It creates two containers side by side on the page and populates the first container with a list of items.
It allows users to drag and drop items from the first container to the second container and provides visual feedback during dragging. 
When an item is dropped into the second container, it displays a success message or updates the UI in any appropriate way. 
Finally, it adds a reset button to clear the second container and reset the first container to its original state.

Thank You!
